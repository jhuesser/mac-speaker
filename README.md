# mac-speaker
A simple bash script, which uses the "say" command on a mac. It will save the entered message in a file.

#Just why?
Yes this script is just using this command:
```
say [-v voice] [-o output] [string]
```

Then why this script exisist?
I've made a animation and neeed a voice comment. So I used this command and save it to a .aiff file. But i got rid of pressing the up key and repleacing the string in the quotes, so i made this simmple script. Not very usefull but it does what it should.
